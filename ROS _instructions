Steps to run on ROS node:

1- Create a new ROS package inside a ROS workspace
	$ cd ~/catkin_ws/src
	$ catkin_create_pkg h264 std_msgs roscpp pcl_conversions pcl_ros pcl_msgs sensor_msgs
	$ cd ~/catkin_ws
	$ catkin_make
	$ . ~/catkin_ws/devel/setup.bash
	
	
	
2 - Add all the src files into ~/catkin_ws/src/h264/src

3 - Create a 'lib' directory inside ~/catkin_ws/src/h264 and add all the .h files (~/catkin_ws/src/h264/lib)
	
4 - Overwrite CMakeList.txt and package.xml files with the ones on the Github repository. This will allow to compile and link all the files, as well as the PCL and OpenCV libraries

6 - Create a 'images' directory in ~/catkin_ws/src/h264 to the converted PNG images

7 - Create a 'output_bitstream' directory in ~/catkin_ws/src/h264 to the output bitstream

8 - Create a 'txt' directory in ~/catkin_ws/src/h264 to the .txt files generated during the execution

9 - Remake the package:
	cd ~/catkin_ws/src
	. ~/catkin_ws/devel/setup.bash
	
	
To run the ROS node:

1 - Open a new terminal and init ros service
	$ roscore

2 - Open a new terminal and run the ros node from package directory
	$ cd ~/catkin_ws/src/h264/
	$ rosrun h264 image_process_node
	
3 - Open a new terminal and run the rosbag
	$ rosbag play kitti.bag
